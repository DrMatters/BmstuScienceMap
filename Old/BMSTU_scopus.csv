We propose a scheme of an experimental facility for determining the thermal conductivity of samples of composite materials in the form of plates, bars, and fiber bundles in the direction of their reinforcement and have substantiated the experimental conditions. In the course of the experiment, in a carbon-filled plastic sample a nonstationary temperature field, whose gradient coincided with the direction of the sample reinforcement plane, was created. We have investigated the possible errors in determining the thermal conductivity of a composite material and the influence of the thermal conductivity of its insulator on their level.

The blowout resistance of fibrous SAM is measured by a direct method. The derived dependence of blowout resistance on material density is approximated with high precision analytically by a power function. The use of dimensionless numbers for processing experimental data and the structural coefficient made it possible to establish the value of the exponent of the power function as equal to two. The direct proportionality of the structural coefficient and the inverse proportionality of blowout resistance to the diameter of fiber were also established.
